/*
Write a program which asks you to enter a name in the form of first middle
initial last. So you might enter for example samuel p. clemens. Use getline to
read in the string because it contains spaces. Also, apparently the shift key
on your keyboard doesnâ€™t work, because you enter it all lower case. Pass the
string to a function which uses .find to locate the letters which need to be
upper case and use toupper to convert those characters to uppercase. The
revised string should then be returned to main in the form Last, First MI
where it will be displayed.
